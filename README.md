# DungeonBuilder

This tool allows the user to build levels for a traditional rogue-like games, with functionality to create, smooth, or fill floors and add corridors and mazes.

Press "i" after starting the program for a list of the commands currently available and the hotkeys to use them.

Eventually, I plan to expand it in to a full-fledged game.
