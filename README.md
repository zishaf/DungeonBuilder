# DungeonBuilder

This tool allows the user to build levels for a traditional rogue-like game, with functionality to create, smooth, or fill floors and add corridors and mazes.

Press "i" after starting the program for a list of the commands currently available and the hotkeys to use them.

Inspiration and some code (marked where applicable) has been taken from the tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Eventually, I plan to expand the project into a full-fledged game.
