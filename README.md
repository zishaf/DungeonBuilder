# DungeonBuilder

Currently the main features are a map builder and a simple game mode you can win by descending far enough.
You can choose either option from the main menu of the program.

Inspiration and some code (marked where applicable) has been taken from the tutorial at http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/
